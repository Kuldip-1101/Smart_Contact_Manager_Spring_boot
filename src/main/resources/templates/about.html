      A contact manager is a software program that enables users to easily store and find contact information, such as names,
      addresses, and telephone numbers. They are contact-centric databases that provide a fully integrated approach to tracking
      all information and communication activities linked to contacts. Simple ones for personal use are included in most smartphones.
      The main reference standard for contact data and metadata, semantic and interchange, is the vCard.
